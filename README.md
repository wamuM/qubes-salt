# Salt 

Welcome to my custom salt config for qubes os

## Pushing to origin
I've made a script to push my changes to origin at `./push_to_origin.sh` it takes in one parameter which is the name of the origin server. You can set up the different origins in the origins.json file in the same dir (there is a origins.json.example file provided as well to use as a template).
